# Declaration of Independence Act of 2018
## Section 1: Preamble
We declare by the common nature of humanity that all people should be allowed the same fundamental rights of life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness. All people should be born with equal dignity and should be given opportunities to make their lives better. And invevitably, the course of human events has led to higher opportunity for all people, but we find that the rights of many people are being violated, and that we need to defend these people's fundamental rights.

In this premise, we conclude that we should remove the political bands between the territories of the State of Arkovia and the Commonwealth of Australia for repeaditly violating people's fundamental human rights of life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness and therefore declare the territories of the State of Arkovia a seperate state than that of the Commonwealth of Australia and of all seprate jurisdictions.
