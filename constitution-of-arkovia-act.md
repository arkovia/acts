The CTC consists of at minimum 8 Omegas, including the council president. Their purpose is to lead the vision, ensure stability and select the leaders of the different Government Entities of the country. The Omega's roles are to inform the council president of all possible options and their outcomes, and assist the council president in fulfilling those projects. The council president has the final choice on all matters, but must consider the opinions, options and outcomes of each omega to reach a final verdict.

##### Term Length
The term of each council president is 5 years unless a majority vote inside the group agrees to extend the current council presidents term, however the current council president must not participate in the vote. When the votes are equal, the proposal shall pass in the negative.

##### Cycle
When a council president has finished their term, and their term is not extended, they are removed from the cycle and cannot be voted for again until the cycle restarts. Each omega will have a term at council presidency. When all omegas have had their term, the cycle is restarted and each omega will have the capability to be a council president. New omegas of the CTC must wait until the next cycle to be capable to run for council presidency.

##### Election
Each new council president is elected by a majority vote inside the group, the current and past council presidents in the cycle are not allowed to be voted for, but can vote on the remaining omegas. If the vote is equal, the current council president is granted the right to a casting vote.
