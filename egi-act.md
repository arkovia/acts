# EGI Act

## Part 1: Foundation

### Introduction
The Arkovian EGI, similar to a ministry or department of government in other countries exists to organize government.

### Purpose
Government bureaucracies allow for government to provide important services to its people in an organised manner.

### Interpretation
Videos for legal interp planned on being made.

### Jurisdiction
The `Genesis Council EGI` and `Arksembly EGI` shall have jurisdiction over this act, however the primary act for EGIs will oversee this one, as this act is a general guideline if anything about the specific running of the EGI is not stated.

## Part 2: Structure
### Section 1: Structure and General Interior
#### Segment 1: Board of Directors
There shall be a Board of Directors governing the actions of the EGI and providing executive decisions and actions. This Board shall consist of a `Prime Executive Minister` (`PEM`) at the very top of the Board of Directors, and therefore the EGI, with other directors at the discretion of the EGI in its governing act (the act it has primary jurisdiction over {ie the Nationality Act governing the Immigration EGI}), by vote of the members of the Board of Director, or by the vote of the Arksembly.

#### Segment 2: Management
There shall be a management level that may exist, depending on the size and importance of the EGI considered. It will be a gateway for the Board of Directors to the general employees, through decisions and funds. There may also be multiple levels of the management, for example, if an EGI gets so big that the management can't communicate decisions to the employees effectively, they may could create another level of management. In this case, they would, as management governed by the Board of Directors govern the wishes of the Board of Directors to the management level below them.

#### Segment 3: General Employees and Workers
There shall be a general employee and worker level that enacts the decisions of the Board of Directors and the management levels. For example, for a parks EGI, these workers would work on the construction and design of parks under the authority of the Board of Directors, and possibly by the direction of the Management (as prescribed under Segment 2).

## Part 3: Funding
### Section 1: Funds Division
#### Segment 1: Establishment & Jurisdiction
Each EGI shall automatically have a funds division, by the name of `[EGI Name] Funding EGI` which has the authority to:
- fund each subdivision of the EGI
- manage and authorize each expenditure of the EGI
- manage the accountings of the EGI and its subdivisions

#### Segment 2: Limitation of Subdivision Fund Divisions
The Board of Directors of each main EGI under the Arkovia EGI shall have the authority to decide if their subdivisions can have their own funds division.
