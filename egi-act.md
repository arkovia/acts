# EGI Act

## Part 1: Foundation

### Introduction
The Arkovian EGI, similar to a ministry or department of government in other countries exists to organize government.

### Purpose
Government bureaucracies allow for government to provide services to its people.

### Interpretation
Videos for legal interp planned on being made.

### Jurisdiction
The `Genesis Council, EGI` and `Arksembly, EGI` shall have jurisdiction over this act, however the primary act for EGIs will oversee this one, as this act is a general guideline if anything about the specific running of the EGI is not stated.

## Part 2: Basic Structure

### Section 1: Structure and General Interior
#### Segment 1: Board of Directors
There shall be a Board of Directors governing the actions of the EGI and providing executive decisions and actions. This Board shall consist of a `Prime Executive Officer` (`PEO`) at the very top, with other directors at the discretion of the EGI in its governing act (the act it has primary jurisdiction over (ie the Nationality Act governing Immigration Arkovia, EGI)

#### Segment 2: Management
There shall be a management level that may or may no exist, depending on the size and importance of the EGI considered. It will be a gateway for the Board of Directors to the general employees, through decisions and funds. There may also be multiple levels of the management, for example, if an EGI gets so big that the management can't communicate decisions to the employees effectively, they may could create another level of management. In this case, they would, as management governed by the Board of Directors govern the wishes of the Board of Directors to the management level below them.

#### Segment 3: General Employees and Workers
There shall be a general employee and worker level that enacts the decisions of the Board of Directors and the management levels. For example, for a parks EGI, these workers would work on the construction and design of parks.
