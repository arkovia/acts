# Introduction to Modern Infrastructure

## Water Infrastructure
Water is one of the 2nd most important human physical needs (after oxygen). We require water on a daily basis. Humans generally cannot survive for more than 3 days without it.

### Example uses

- Toilets
- Drinking Water
- Cooking
- Hygiene
- Gardening
- Air Conditioning

### Obtaining Water

There are various methods of obtaining water today. Some are virtually free or inexpensive, while others require more expensive treatment.

#### Mountain Water
Mountain water is one of the most commonely used forms of obtaining water, it works when mountains condense clouds, rain and moisture into water. That water eventually runs into streams and is collected at a dam point. Sometimes it is treated, other times it is safe to drink. It is a renewable source, however it may require reseviors to ensure a stable supply during hot summers or droughts.

#### Desalination
Desalination is the act of aquiring water through the removal of salt (and other impurities) in seawater. It is also another common form of aquiring water. More and more countries are turning towards desalination to solve water crisis in growing cities & nations, especially with isolated desert cities, such as Dubai.

Desalination is a reliable, renewable source of water, but can sometimes be expensive.

Various methods of desalination exist. For example:
- Reverse Osmosis
- Multi-Stage Flash Desalination
- Filteration
- Vacuum Desalination

#### Aquifier Water
Smaller, desert & isolated cities often turn to aquifier water to supply towns and cities with water. Aquifiers are underground stores of water, which can be accessed through wells, caves, and pumping. Some underground reseviors may take lots of time to renew, and are sometimes not considered renewable.

#### Rain Water
Rain water is another form of collecting & obtaining water, however it may contain contaminants from air. Cities that use rain water often obtain it from rainwater drains. It is considered renewable, but unstable.

It is often paired with other form of water collection.

#### Recycling Water
Recycling and treating waste water is a very common way of obtaining water. Human waste water requires extensive treatment.

Nations often treat water to avoid sending sewage to lakes, rivers and seas where humans consume from.

Water reclamation is important for modern nations.

## Sewage Infrastructure
Sewage infrastructure regards the collection (and sometimes treatment) of waste water. Waste water may sometimes come in form of storm drain water, human waste & other household use.

It's extremely important to modern nations to have a form of sewage infrastructure to avoid dangerous health issues which arise from open defacation.

There are two important parts of sewage infrastructure: 

### Sewage Collection & Transport
Sewage collection has historically required underground gravity sewage systems, with pumping stations every once and a while, depending on the circumstances. However, this is no longer the case. Modern/newer cities can now install vacuum sewage waste collection systems that collect sewage via vacuum pipes, powered by base stations that can support thousands of homes. Vacuum sucks waste into base stations, where they are either treated, or sent to a dedicated treatment facility.

There are various advandages to vaccume sewage systems. They are listed below:

- Can be sucked uphill.
- Don't require expensive mining for gravity pumps.
- Don't require anywhere near as many pumping stations.
- No leakage into enviroment.
- Simple installations.
- Require less water for toilets.
- Can handle huge amounts of waste, through high vacuum speeds.

### Sewage Treatment
Sewage treatment involves treating various wastes, such as human waste, household waste or stormwater waste.

Sewage is firstly seperated from solids, through multiple stages.

It's possible for the solids to be dried, and then burnt for energy. Various facilities exist that are powered entirely by waste.

The sewage then goes through various treatment methods, such as filtration, UV treatment, chemical treatments.

Sewage can then be recycled, stored and drank (when well treated).

## Road Infrastructure
Road infrastucture is extremely important in almost every city. Road infrastructure also includes walking paths, highways, streets, traffic control systems, and public transport infrastructure.

Modern cities may include underground infrastructure and sometimes underground tunnels for infrastructure.

## Energy Infrastructure
Energy Infrastructure is one of the more complicated forms of infrastructure and involve the generation, transport and distribution of energy to citizens, homes and businesses.
